Hometown Exodus

Based on a project in the Havelland, Germany I started to ask myself the question,
why life in the own hometown is becoming more and more unattractive to many young people.

"Most of the young people that go to college go away, and then they don't come back"

But where are the roots of this hometown exodus?

In a survey, I try to find out the motivation behind leaving or staying in the hometown
and the dreams people hope to find in their new home.

The result shows, that the main reason for leaving is the carreer. 
Most leave in their 20's and start to study at a university in their home country.
