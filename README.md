Based on a project in the Havelland, Germany I started to ask myself the question,
why life in the own hometown is becoming more and more unattractive to many young people.

"Most of the young people that go to college go away, and then they don't come back"

But where are the roots of this hometown exodus?

In a survey, I try to find out the motivation behind leaving or staying in the hometown
and the dreams people hope to find in their new home.

The result shows, that the main reason for leaving is the carreer. 
Most leave in their 20's and start to study at a university in their home country.

To get a general overview for the topic, I posted the survey in a social network in different groups. Around 100 people took part of it and helped me to see, that the main reason for leaving the home is the further education after school like university and employments.

Most participants are from germany and many from the university of applied science Potsdam, so the visualization shows especially this "group" of people. Most of them are from germany and just moved cities for their studies.

The result might change from country to country and show other motivations for leaving home like political or family circumstances.
